Call by value and reference:
=============================

When passing parameters to a function in C++, there is a variety of strategies a programmer can choose from. In this section, we will take a look at these in turn from the perspective of stack usage. First, we will briefly revisit the definition of scope, as well as the strategies call-by-value and call-by-reference. Then, we will look at the amount of stack memory used by these methods.
