// Inheritance
// In this exercise you will practice building an inheritance hierarchy.

// Instructions
// Define a class Animal.
// Define 3 member variables: color, name, age.
// Define a derived class Snake that inherits from the base class Animal.
// Create a member variable length for the Snake class.
// Create a derived class Cat that inherits from the base class Animal.
// Create a member variable height for the Cat class.
// Create MakeSound() member functions for each of the derived classes.
// In the main() function instantiate Snake and Cat objects. Initialize both their unique and derived attributes. Program them to make a sound.

// Define base class Animal

// Declare derived class Snake

// Declare derived class Cat

// Test in main()
